In the heart of a bustling city, there was a hidden garden that only a few knew about, where time seemed to stand still. At the foot of its central tree sat a man, wise and old, eyes closed, silent and still, his silk robes falling to the stone-brick ground beneath him. He was known as the Guardian of Stories, keeper of ancient tales that held the power to change destinies and unlock secrets buried deep within the hearts of those who sought him. Most rode him off as crazy, and thus the garden was dismissed into obscurity along with him in the minds of those in the city.

But one day, a curious young girl named Lila stumbled upon the garden while chasing a fluttering butterfly, and her wide-eyed wonder brought new life to the forgotten sanctuary. From behind a pillar, she hid from the man and watched for minutes in anticipation. Eventually, her curiosity got the better of her, and she took a tentative step forward, her small voice breaking the silence, "Who are you, and what stories do you guard?" The man turned and looked at her with the warmest of smiles, "My child, I guard nothing. Come, sit, I have something to show you." As Lila approached, he gently extended his hand, and with a subtle flick of his fingers, a soft glow emanated from the ground, revealing intricate patterns and symbols that danced in the air like wisps of light.

Lila's gaze was a gasp at the impossible little miracles dancing around in front of her, lighting her up with joy inside, as the reflection of little dancing blue sprites bounced off of her startled eyes. The Guardian chuckled softly, "These sprites are the keepers of stories, my dear. Each one holds a tale from long ago, waiting to be shared with those who dare to listen."

"Who are you?" said Lila. "Will the sprites speak to me? I'll dare to listen, I will!" Lila said, almost tripping over her words. The Guardian nodded, his eyes twinkling with wisdom. "I am merely a storyteller, a bridge between the past and the present. The sprites will speak to you if you open your heart and mind to their whispers." He closed his eyes, and the blue sprites began to hum a melodious tune, filling the air with an enchanting rhythm. A look of confusion and despair touched Lila's young face as she worked her brain to try and understand what the man's words meant. Sensing her uncertainty, the Guardian placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder and whispered, "Just trust in your own heart, Lila, and the stories will reveal themselves to you."

The man's words were comforting to Lila, and for whatever reason, she trusted him fully, despite only just having met him. As she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, Lila felt a warm, gentle breeze envelop her, carrying with it the faint whispers of the sprites' stories. Visions crossed her inner eye, visions of a beautiful planet, filled with marvellous and impossibly intricate technology woven into the land itself. As the visions unfolded, Lila felt a deep connection to this mysterious world, sensing that its secrets were intertwined with her own destiny.

She saw mountains of gold, hills of impossible height, sages of incomprehensible wisdom, an ancient world, long ago. The whispers guided her further into the vision, revealing a prophecy that spoke of a young girl destined to uncover the lost knowledge of this ancient world and bring harmony to her own. She then heard a voice that addressed her by name. "Lila, you are the chosen one," the voice said, echoing through her mind with a gentle yet powerful resonance. "Though you do not remember your spirit's life, you have anticipated your physical form here for aeons." Lila's heart raced as the voice continued, "Your journey begins now, and the wisdom of this ancient world will guide you in fulfilling your destiny. Trust in your intuition, as your ancestors are always with you." 

As the vision faded, Lila opened her eyes to find the Guardian smiling at her, his expression filled with a mix of pride and anticipation for the journey that awaited her. "Ah, my little friend, go now, a bright future awaits you." With a heart full of newfound purpose, Lila nodded to the Guardian, then turned and walked back into the bustling city, carrying the secrets of the hidden garden and the ancient stories within her. She whizzed through the streets of her Korean city which she had passed through a million times in her life. Her heart raced with excitement and purpose, knowing that the secrets of the hidden garden and the ancient stories would guide her in ways she had never imagined before. That which she carried home with her that day was not rational, as if visionaries and dreamers alike ever were anything of the sort. Instead, it was a gift of insight and wonder, sparking a fire within her that would illuminate the path to her true calling, guiding her steps with the wisdom of the ancients.
